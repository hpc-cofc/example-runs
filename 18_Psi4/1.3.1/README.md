# Psi4Conda 1.3.1

Psi4 is a modular open-source suite of ab initio quantum chemistry programs designed for efficient,
high-accuracy simulations of a variety of molecular properties. It is very easy to use and has an
optional Python interface. Learn more at (psicode.org)[http://www.psicode.org]

Here is a quick example of SMP parallel Psi4 job that calculates the interaction energy of water
dimer using the SAPT2+3(CCD) method.
